                        <p class="card-text">
                        <p class="lead">In 1982, James Wilson and George Kelling formulated a theory according to
                            which if someone broke the glass in a house and no one inserted a new one, then soon not a
                            single whole window would remain in that house, and then looting would begin. In other
                            words, clear signs of disorder and non-compliance by people with accepted norms of behavior
                            provoke others to forget about the rules too. As a result of the resulting chain reaction, a
                            "decent" urban area can quickly turn into a cloaca, where people are afraid to go out.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">The theory has found wide application in practice - first in New York, and then
                            in many other cities in the USA, Europe, Georgia, South Africa, Indonesia, etc. By carefully
                            monitoring the cleanliness of the streets and removing graffiti from the walls, the New York
                            authorities not only taught citizens to behave more culturally, but also achieved a
                            significant decrease in crime in the city.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">Sociologists at the University of Groningen (Netherlands) conducted six
                            experiments to test the truth of the theory of broken windows.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title display-5">Experiment 1</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The first experiment was carried out on a street with many shops, near the wall
                            of a house, where Groningen people who come to shop park their bicycles. There was a bright,
                            conspicuous sign against this wall, prohibiting painting on the walls. At first, the wall
                            was clean. The experimenters hung a piece of paper on the handlebars of each bicycle (there
                            were 77 bicycles in total) with the words "We wish you all happy holidays!" and the logo of
                            a defunct sporting goods store. Hiding in a secluded corner, the researchers began to
                            observe the actions of cyclists. There were no trash bins on the street, so a person could
                            either throw a piece of paper on the ground, or hang it on another bicycle, or take it with
                            him to throw it away later. The first two options were considered as a violation of the
                            accepted norms, the third as their observance.
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">Out of 77 cyclists, only 25 (33%) behaved uncivilized. Then the experiment was
                            repeated, in the same weather and at the same time of the day, after having painted the wall
                            with empty drawings. This time, 53 people out of 77 (69%) littered. The revealed difference
                            has a high degree of statistical significance. Thus, violating the ban on painting on walls
                            has proven to be a serious incentive for people to break another generally accepted rule -
                            not litter on the streets.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title display-5">Experiment 2</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The second experiment was to show whether the theory of broken windows is valid
                            only for generally accepted norms, or whether it also applies to local rules established for
                            a particular situation or place. The researchers blocked the main entrance to the car park
                            with a fence, in which, however, a wide gap was left. Next to it they hung a sign "No entry,
                            bypass 200 m to the right", as well as a notice "It is forbidden to fasten bicycles to the
                            fence." The experiment was again carried out in two versions: "the order is observed" and
                            "the order is violated." In the first case, four bicycles were standing a meter away from
                            the fence, clearly not fastened to it. In the second case, the same bicycles were fastened
                            to the fence. From a secluded place, the experimenters observed how citizens who came for
                            their cars would behave: they would go around the fence or crawl through a hole. The result
                            turned out to be positive: in the situation "the order is observed" only 27% of car owners
                            crawled through the hole, and in the situation "the order was violated" - 82%.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title display-5">Experiment 3</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The third experiment was carried out in an underground supermarket parking lot
                            with a large, highly visible notice “Please return shopping carts taken from the store”. In
                            the situation "the order was observed" there were no carts in the parking lot, in the
                            situation "the order was violated" there were four carts. The researchers prudently smeared
                            their pens with fuel oil so that the visitors would not have a desire to use them. The same
                            pieces of paper were attached to the machines as in the first experiment. The result was
                            similar: in the first situation, 30% of drivers threw a piece of paper on the ground, in the
                            second - 58%.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title display-5">Experiment 4</h2>
                        <p class="lead">The fourth experiment resembled the first, with the difference that the signs of
                            “violation of norms by other people” were now not visual, but sound. In the Netherlands, the
                            use of firecrackers and fireworks on New Year's Eve is prohibited by law. It turned out that
                            cyclists are much more likely to throw pieces of paper on the ground if they hear the sound
                            of exploding firecrackers.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="card-title display-5">Experiments 5 and 6</h2>
                        <p class="lead">
                            In the fifth and sixth experiments, people were provoked to petty theft. An envelope with a
                            transparent window was sticking out of the mailbox, from which a 5 euro note was clearly
                            visible. The experimenters watched people passing by, counting the number of thefts. In a
                            “good order” situation, the mailbox was clean and there was no garbage around. In a “out of
                            order” situation, either the box was painted with meaningless graffiti (experiment 5), or
                            rubbish was lying around (experiment 6).
                        </p>
                        <p class="lead">In the situation "the order is observed" only 13% of passers-by (out of 71) took
                            the envelope. However, 27% of passers-by (out of 60) stole an envelope from a painted box,
                            and scattered garbage provoked 25% of people to steal (out of 72).
